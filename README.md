## Focus on Specific Behavioral Factors - Substance Use

The CDC Survey included a myriad of questions about different behavioral factors, and ones that caught our attention were the use of Alcohol, Tobacco/E-Cigarettes, and Marijuana. How do these vices affect our heart??

First step was to import the CDC data and convert file from SAS to .csv. Columns were removed, renamed, and cleaned with Pandas and Jupyter Notebook in order to analyze in Tableau (see 'Heart_Disease.ipynb' and 'tableau_df.ipynb' jupyter notebooks).

The .csv output from 'tableau_df' was used in Tableau to visualize the impact that the different substances have on heart disease. The published Tableau story on Substance Use highlights key findings on the affects of Alcohol, Tobacco/E-Cig, and Marijuana. Non-alcohol drinkers have a slightly higher risk than alcohol drinkers to suffer from heart disease, while males over the age of 60 who are current or former smokers are roughly 2x more likely than females to be at risk for heart disease.
